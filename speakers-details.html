My career trajectory transitioned from architecture to infrastructure planning, driven by a commitment to addressing critical issues faced by communities, particularly in developing countries like India. Witnessing the profound impacts of climate change, notably the 2018 floods in Kerala and Coorg, underscored the urgency for diverse expertise to contribute meaningfully to societal challenges. This experience ignited my belief that professionals can serve the country in multiple ways.
In my current role at CDD India, I focus on Water and Sanitation projects, specifically leading initiatives in Water Security for villages in North Karnataka. Additionally, I actively contribute to the dissemination of knowledge on DEWATS (Decentralized Wastewater Treatment Systems), promoting sustainable solutions for wastewater management.
My professional ethos revolves around prioritizing practical solutions over aesthetics, particularly in the context of urban services. I am dedicated to leveraging my expertise to effect positive change, addressing the vital needs of communities in our dynamic world.
